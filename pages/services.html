### Software consultation

While the lab staff does not teach statistics, we can provide basic help to users who are getting started with statistical applications such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, and Excel.

### Data resource consultation

As a policy, the library acquires and subscribes to services that provide access to numeric data. We also maintain contact with an international network of data archivists.
Data acquisition

If you have a particular data need, the Library may be able to purchase it for you depending on the nature of the material, the licensing requirements, and the availability of funds.
